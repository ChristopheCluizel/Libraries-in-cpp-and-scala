Libraries in Scala and C++
==========================

Some libraries I often use in my projects, both in Scala and C++ :

## Scala

- Graph : class representing a graph with several basic algorithms (breadthFirstSearch, eccentricity). One version with an adjacent matrix implementation and one with an adjacent list implementation.
- Tic-toc : class for easy benshmarking of different parts of the code. By fgysin.

## C++

- Point2D : class representing a point in 2D with some very basic methods (Euclidean distance, translation, rotation)
