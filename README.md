Libraries in Scala
==========================

Some libraries in Scala I often use in my projects:

- Graph : class representing a graph with several basic algorithms (breadthFirstSearch, eccentricity). One version with an adjacent matrix implementation and one with an adjacent list implementation.
- Tic-toc : class for easy benshmarking of different parts of the code. By fgysin.
